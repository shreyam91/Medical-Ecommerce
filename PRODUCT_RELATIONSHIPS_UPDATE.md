# Product Relationships Update

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Database Relationships
**Problem**: The product table had no foreign key relationships to main_category, sub_category, or disease tables, making it impossible to properly filter products by these entities.

**Solution**: 
- Added `main_category_id` and `sub_category_id` foreign key columns to the product table
- Created a `product_disease` junction table for many-to-many relationships between products and diseases
- Added proper indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Boolean Filter Bug
**Problem**: Products with `top_products=false`, `people_preferred=false`, etc. were still showing up when filtering for `top_products=true`.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the controller logic to only filter when the value is explicitly `'true'`
- Updated the query to use `AND p.column = true` instead of checking for undefined values

## Database Changes

### New Schema Structure

```sql
-- Updated product table
ALTER TABLE product 
ADD COLUMN main_category_id INTEGER REFERENCES main_category(id),
ADD COLUMN sub_category_id INTEGER REFERENCES sub_category(id);

-- New junction table for product-disease relationships
CREATE TABLE product_disease (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES product(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    disease_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES disease(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(product_id, disease_id)
);
```

### Performance Indexes
- Added indexes on foreign key columns
- Added partial indexes on boolean flags (only for true values)
- Added indexes on junction table relationships

## API Changes

### Enhanced Product Filtering

The `/api/product` endpoint now supports proper relationship-based filtering:

```javascript
// Filter by main category
GET /api/product?mainCategorySlug=vitamins

// Filter by sub category  
GET /api/product?subCategorySlug=pain-relief

// Filter by disease
GET /api/product?diseaseSlug=diabetes

// Boolean filters (fixed - only shows products where flag is true)
GET /api/product?top_products=true
GET /api/product?people_preferred=true
```

### New Endpoints

1. **Get Product with Relationships**
   ```
   GET /api/product/:identifier/relationships
   ```
   Returns product with all related categories and diseases.

2. **Product-Disease Management**
   ```
   GET /api/product-disease/product/:productId/diseases
   GET /api/product-disease/disease/:diseaseId/products
   POST /api/product-disease (admin only)
   DELETE /api/product-disease/:productId/:diseaseId (admin only)
   ```

### Updated Product Creation/Update

Products can now be created/updated with proper relationships:

```javascript
{
  "name": "Product Name",
  "main_category_id": 1,
  "sub_category_id": 2,
  "disease_ids": [1, 2, 3], // Array of disease IDs
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Migration Instructions

1. **Run the migration script**:
   ```bash
   node backend/scripts/migrate_product_relationships.js
   ```

2. **Update existing products** (optional):
   - Manually set `main_category_id` and `sub_category_id` for existing products
   - Add disease relationships via the new API endpoints

## Frontend Impact

The frontend will now receive additional data in product responses:

```javascript
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Product Name",
  // ... existing fields
  "main_category_name": "Vitamins",
  "main_category_slug": "vitamins",
  "sub_category_name": "Vitamin D",
  "sub_category_slug": "vitamin-d",
  "diseases": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Diabetes", "slug": "diabetes"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Hypertension", "slug": "hypertension"}
  ]
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Proper Data Relationships**: Products are now properly linked to categories and diseases
2. **Better Search**: Enhanced search functionality across related entities
3. **Fixed Filtering**: Boolean flags now work correctly
4. **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexes
5. **Scalability**: Many-to-many disease relationships support complex medical categorization
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing category field is maintained for compatibility

## Testing

Test the following scenarios:

1. **Category Filtering**:
   - Filter products by main category slug
   - Filter products by sub category slug
   - Verify proper relationships are returned

2. **Disease Filtering**:
   - Filter products by disease slug
   - Verify many-to-many relationships work

3. **Boolean Filtering**:
   - Request `top_products=true` - should only return products with flag set to true
   - Verify products with false flags are not included

4. **Search Enhancement**:
   - Search should now include category and disease names
   - Verify search results include related entity matches
